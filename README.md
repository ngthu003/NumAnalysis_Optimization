# Optimization & Numerical Analysis

This repository is a selection of my works on Optimization and Numerical Analysis classes, at UCSD and for self-study.

1. __Numerical Analysis__

    1. Solving a linear system of the form Ax = b, where A is a (not necessarily square) matrix exactly and approximately.
    2. Diagonalizing and doing Singular Value Decomposition.
    3. Approximating solutions of non-linear equations.
    4. Approximating and interpolating polynomials from a set of data points.

This will be updated as new works are done and can be published.
